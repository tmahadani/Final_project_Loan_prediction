# Final_project_Loan_prediction
Many people are applying for loans in bank. All these loans are not approvable. Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loanâ€™s interest. The main objective of banks is to invest their assets in safe customers. Up to now many banks are processing loans after regress process of verification and validation. But till now no bank can give surety that the customer who is chosen for loan application is safe or not. So to avoid this situation I introduced a system for the approval of bank loans known as Loan Prediction System Using Python.
